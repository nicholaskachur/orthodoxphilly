<p>Hello and welcome to <strong>Orthodox Philly</strong>. I&rsquo;m
   your host, Nicholas. <span id="salutation">Happy Day! ðŸŽ‰</span>
</p>

<p>
    Philadelphia has a rich tradition of Orthodox Christian expression.
    There are dozens of parishes in the Greater Metropolitan Area, and
    many other ways to get involved.
</p>

<p>
    Former iterations of this website aimed to educate about all the
    parishes and events going on in the area, but I&rsquo;ve reined in
    my ambitions since then. If you have any questions, comments, or
    concerns, please send an email to
    <a href="mailto:info@orthodoxphilly.org">info@orthodoxphilly.org</a>,
    and I&rsquo;ll see if there&rsquo;s anything I can do to help.
</p>

<h2>Seeking a parish?</h2>
<p>
    Finding a parish community is a deeply personal affair. Some people
    will love the parish closest to them, others will have to try a few
    before finding a forever home.
</p>
<p>
    As you look for parishes, there are several locators you can use:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of America
        <a href="https://www.assemblyofbishops.org/directories/parishes">
        Parish Locator</a></li>
    <li>The Orthodoxy in America
        <a href="https://orthodoxyinamerica.org/">
        Parish Locator</a></li>
    <li>The Standing Conference of Oriental Orthodox Churches
        <a href="http://www.scooch.org/explore/find-a-parish/">
        Parish Locator</a>
        <em>(this one was not functioning last I tried it)</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Seeking community?</h2>
<p>
    In addition to parishes, the following Facebook groups are lightly
    active.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PhiladelphiaPanOrthodoxGroup">
        Philadelphia Pan-Orthodox (Young Adult)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/orthodoxphilly">
        Orthodox Philly</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a relatively active GroupMe chat for area young adults. You
   can ask for details in either of those Facebook groups.
</p>

<h2>Seeking to learn?</h2>
<p>
   One of my favorite resources for learning about Orthodoxy is
   <a href="https://www.ancientfaith.com/">Ancient Faith Ministries</a>.
   They produce a wide variety of podcasts and other materials that you
   can use on your own time. Just remember the words from the Gospel of
   John, eventually you have to &ldquo;come and see.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>Seeking to give or volunteer?</h2>
<p>
   There are a variety of philanthropic efforts hosted by the various
   parishes throughout the region. Asking around your parish is a good
   place to start, but after that let me suggest three pan-Orthodox
   ministries: <a href="https://focusphiladelphia.org">FOCUS Philadelphia</a>,
   <a href="https://iocc.org/">IOCC</a>, and
   <a href="https://www.projectmexico.org/">Project Mexico</a>.
</p>

<p>
   <strong>FOCUS Philadelphia</strong> is the Fellowship of Orthodox
   Christians United to Serve. As of April 2025, we serve an outdoor
   meal every week in Center City Philadelphia to the poor and hungry.
   We gather donations and volunteers to serve those in need, and we
   hope to expand our operations to other sites in the near future.
</p>
<p>Interested folks are welcome to volunteer with us, whether in
   preparing or serving food, and we gratefully accept donations. You
   can find more information on the
   <a href="https://focusphiladelphia.org">FOCUS Philadelphia Website</a>.
   <em>Self-disclosure: I&rsquo;m on the advisory board, so I&rsquo;m a little
       biased.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>IOCC</strong> is the International Orthodox Christian Charities.
   I&rsquo;m less familiar with them, but I always hear good things about
   their disaster response, emergency assistance, and various other
   humanitarian programs. They operate here in the United States and
   in countries like Greece, Ethiopia, and the Holy Land, among others.
</p>

<p>My understanding is the Philadelphia Community throws a benefit
   banquet every year, but I&rsquo;m sure there are other ways to get
   involved throughout the year, just check out the
   <a href="https://iocc.org/">IOCC Website</a>.
</p>

<p>Finally, a dear friend is a big booster for
   <strong>Project Mexico</strong>, which sponsors an orphanage and
   homebuilding in Northern Mexico. My friend regularly leads a team
   for a week-long trip whose goal is to build a whole new house for a
   family in need. There are teams every year from a variety of places,
   so you can learn more on the <a href="https://www.projectmexico.org/">
   Project Mexico Website</a>.
</p>

<h2>Seeking more?</h2>
<p>This is just a small sampling of Orthdoxy in Philadelphia. Please
   join me and us as a part of this community, seeking faith, growth,
   and service together.</p>
