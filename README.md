# orthodoxphilly

Landing page for Orthodox Christian Philadelphians.

This website descends from a line of prior websites that were a little
more ambitious. As the current maintainer, I haven't invested much
time or seen much interest in it, so it's moving here as a simple
GitHub page to reduce hosting costs.
